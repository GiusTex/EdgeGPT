# EdgeGPT
Extension for Text Generation Webui based on [EdgeGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/EdgeGPT) by acheong08, a reverse engineered API of Microsoft's Bing Chat AI.
Now you can give a sort of Internet access to your characters, easily, quickly and free.

## How to Run
1. Clone [oobabooga's  original repository](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) and follow the instructions until you can chat with a chatbot.

2. Open the extensions folder and clone here this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GiusTex/EdgeGPT.git
```

3. Activate the `textgen` conda environment (from the linked instructions, or TextGenerationWebui\installer_files\env if you used the one-click installer), then if you see in console: `(path\to\textgen) path\to\text-generation-webui\extensions>` or `(path\to\TextGenerationWebui\installer_files\env) path\to\TextGenerationWebui\text-generation-webui\extensions>`, run the following commands to install EdgeGPT:
```bash
pip install -r EdgeGPT/requirements.txt
```

4. Install [Cookie Editor](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cookie-editor/ajfboaconbpkglpfanbmlfgojgndmhmc) for Microsoft Edge.

5. Go to [bing.com](https://www.bing.com/) and copy the cookies in a file.
     If you can't find the extension on Microsoft Edge, follow these steps:

      1- Click the puzzle icon;
      
      2- Click the cookie icon;
      
      3- Click the fifth option on top, to copy them.
      
   Now that you have copied them, go inside text-generation-webui\extensions\EdgeGPT and paste the cookies settings in cookies.txt, then rename it to cookies.json and    press enter.

6. Run the server with the EdgeGPT extension. If all goes well, you should see it reporting "ok"
```bash
python server.py --chat --extensions EdgeGPT
```

## Features
- Changeable keyword to activate Bing when you need and how you want
- Button to leave activated Bing
- 5 debug buttons to show or print different parts of the prompt
- Works in chat-mode, so you can use your desired characters
- Editable Bing context within the webui

Keyword
> Start the prompt with Hey Bing, the default keyword to activate Bing when you need, and Bing will search and give an answer, that will be fed to the 
  character memory before it answers you.

Debug buttons
 > If the bot answer doesn't suit you, you can turn on "Show Bing Output" to show the Bing output in the webui, sometimes it doesn't answer well and need better search words.

  You can also print in the console other prompt parts (user input, whole prompt, "raw" Bing output, Bing output + custom context):

Chat-mode
> It works with "chat, streaming, non-streaming" modes (the ones I have tested).
Change keyword
> Change the Bing activation word within the webui, from EdgeGPT options (punctuation marks are not supported, they give error).

Edit Bing context
> Now you can customize the context around the Bing output.

## New:
Overwrite Activation Word
> Added Overwrite Activation Word, while this is turned on Bing will always answer you without the need of an activation word, if you don't want to mess your prompt 
  with a keyword that doesn't fit in.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112352961/235376642-32435472-23f1-4ee0-ac6c-e070d1867305.png" width="710" height="157" />

## How does it work
Inside the function "input_modifier" the code looks for the chosen word:
```bash
BingOutput = re.search(ChosenWord, UserInput)
```
Then, if it finds it, it adds it to "custom_generate_chat_prompt" at line 137:
```bash
        #Adding BingString
        if(BingOutput!=None) and not OverwriteWord:
            async def EdgeGPT():
                global UserInput
                global RawBingString
                bot = Chatbot(cookie_path='extensions/EdgeGPT/cookies.json')
                response = await bot.ask(prompt=UserInput, conversation_style=ConversationStyle.creative)
                # Select only the bot response from the response dictionary
                for message in response["item"]["messages"]:
                    if message["author"] == "bot":
                        bot_response = message["text"]
                # Remove [^#^] citations in response
                RawBingString = re.sub('\[\^\d+\^\]', '', str(bot_response))
                await bot.close()
                #print("\nBingString output:\n", RawBingString)
                return RawBingString
            asyncio.run(EdgeGPT())
            global RawBingString
            global BingString
            BingString="Important informations:" + RawBingString + "\n" + "Now answer the following question based on the given informations. If my sentence starts with \"Hey Bing\" ignore that part, I'm referring to you anyway, so don't say you are Bing.\n"
            rows.append(BingString)
        elif OverwriteWord:
            async def EdgeGPT():
                global UserInput
                global RawBingString
                global PrintRawBingString
                bot = Chatbot(cookie_path='extensions/EdgeGPT/cookies.json')
                response = await bot.ask(prompt=UserInput, conversation_style=ConversationStyle.creative)
                # Select only the bot response from the response dictionary
                for message in response["item"]["messages"]:
                    if message["author"] == "bot":
                        bot_response = message["text"]
                # Remove [^#^] citations in response
                RawBingString = re.sub('\[\^\d+\^\]', '', str(bot_response))
                await bot.close()
                if PrintRawBingString:
                    print("\nRawBingString output:\n", RawBingString)
                return RawBingString
            asyncio.run(EdgeGPT())
            BingString=BingContext1 + RawBingString + "\n" + BingContext2
            if PrintBingString:
                print("\nBing output + context:\n", BingString)
            rows.append(BingString)
``` 
And at the end it takes RawBingString and adds it another bit of context, generating BingString so the bot memory has the Bing output. If you want you can also change the context around the RawBingString at line 118 inside script.py, to better suit your desidered answer.
```bash
BingString="Important informations:" + RawBingString + "\n" + "Now answer the following question based on the given informations. If my sentence starts with \"Hey Bing\" ignore that part, I'm referring to you anyway, so don't say you are Bing.\n"
```

## Weaknesses:
Sometimes the character ignores the Bing output, even if it is in his memory. Being still a new application, you are welcome to make tests to find your optimal result, be it clearing the conversation, changing the context around the Bing output, or something else.

## Contributing
Pull requests, suggestions and bug reports are welcome, but as I'm not a programmer I can't guarantee I'll be of help.
I could add something but I don't know if I'll have the will; some ideas I had in mind, and they should be moderately simple, are configuring it to be usable with the oobabooga API, and activating EdgeGPT with another button, without having to write "Hey Bing", but I didn't put them because I don't know if it's worth it.
